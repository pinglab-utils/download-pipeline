Poor breathing results in too much carbon dioxide (hypoventilation) and too little oxygen in the blood (hypoxemia). These changes can lead to serious health problems, such as leg edema, pulmonary hypertension, cor pulmonale, and secondary erythrocytosis(Obesity hypoventilation syndrome :OHS). If left untreated, OHS can even be fatal. Many people who have OHS also have obstructive sleep apnea. [2]\\nThe central features of OHS, as currently accepted, include obesity (BMI >30 kg/m2), chronic alveolar hypoventilation leading to daytime hypercapnia and hypoxia (PaCO2 >45 mm Hg and PaO2 < 70 mm Hg), and sleep-disordered breathing. Essential to the diagnosis is exclusion of other causes of alveolar hypoventilation such as severe obstructive or restrictive pulmonary disease, significant kyphoscoliosis, severe hypothyroidism, neuromuscular diseases, or other central hypoventilation syndromes.[3]',\n",
